# Creating an Amazon RDS instance using MariaDB Engine

This project creates an EC2 instance and an RDS for MariaDB DB instance. The project shows you how to access the DB instance from the EC2 instance using a standard MySQL client. As a best practice, this project creates a private DB instance in a virtual private cloud (VPC). In most cases, other resources in the same VPC, such as EC2 instances, can access the DB instance, but resources outside of the VPC can't access it.
