# Connect your EC2 instance and MariaDB DB instance automatically

You can automatically connect an existing EC2 instance to a DB instance using the RDS console. The RDS console simplifies setting up the connection between an EC2 instance and your MariaDB DB instance. For this tutorial, set up a connection between the EC2 instance and the MariaDB DB instance that you created previously.

Before setting up a connection between an EC2 instance and an RDS database, make sure you meet the requirements described in Overview of automatic connectivity with an EC2 instance.

If you change these security groups after you configure connectivity, the changes might affect the connection between the EC2 instance and the RDS database.
